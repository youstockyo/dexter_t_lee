				<h1>"Notable Quotable"</h1>
				<p>Dexter T. Lee was born Dexter T. Lee in Lakemont Heights, California, the city where the water meets the sky.  His father, Desmond Lee was an antique dealer specializing in spoons and bells and his mother, Deborah Lee was famed basketball coach for the Lakemont Heights Flying Fish. Dexter T. Lee was never good at sports or collectibles so he decided to pursue music. </p>
				<p>Dexter T. Lee began writing and performing at a very young age.  At school all he could think about was music and once school was out, he would rush home to avoid getting kidnapped.  He describes his early music to be half hip-hop, half R&amp;B, half pop and half rock.  He did not do well in math.</p>
				<p>Over the last year his career has been steady.  He finally came in first at his city’s annual talent show, LAKEMONT HEIGHTS GOT TALENT!  and was named “Artist to Watch” in the widely popular local publication, WHERE THE FISH FLY.</p>
				<p>He continues to push himself and his music to next level levels.  He feels blessed to be on this journey.</p>
